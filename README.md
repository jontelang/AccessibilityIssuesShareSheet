**Summary**

This project demonstrates how the accessibility API lets us access all buttons in an action sheet, but does not show the labels for all.

(This specific issue seems to be for iOS 11, other iOS versions does not show the buttons outside of the scroll area at all (tested on iOS 9 and 10).)

**HowTo**

Just run the UI test in the project. Stop with a breakpoint and run "po app" to see the output.
